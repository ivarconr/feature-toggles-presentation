Unleash your features gradually
At FINN.no we are 120 developers deploying code to production multiple times a
day. When a new feature is complete we use Unleash to gradually roll the new feature to
our users. This allows us to verify new features before enabling them to all.
In this talk I will briefly introduce the feature toggle technique in general and how
this allows us to separate deploy and the release of new features. I will also
introduce Unleash, an open source feature toggle system, we developed to solve
this issue. An yes, it is written in Node.

Ivar Ã˜sthus loves to play with new frontend technologies. The last few years he has
been working as a frontend developer and architect at FINN.no.
