At FINN.no we do continuous delivery!

- ~385 deployable projects
- ~600 new artifacts deployed every week
- 140 developers
 => 4,3 deployments per developer per week.

Master branch => highway to production
- Code checked in @Â master
 => unit tests
 => automatically deployed to internal test envs
 => integration tests trigged
 => New code ready to be deployed to production!

Challenges:
- requires clean master!
- does not allow for unfinnished features at the master branch
- new features requires some time to be developed
 - many persons involved
 - many teams
- Test envs != production envs

Feature branches
- simple technique
- new features are seperated in new branches
- keeps the master branch clean
- we merge when new feature is ready.

Feature branches: multiple features
