# Unleash your features gradually

.small.leftify[
_At FINN.no we are 140 developers deploying code to production multiple times a
day. We have a few web applications and a few hundred running micro-services in
production and integrate code in production even before new features are ready
for the end user. And when the feature is complete we gradually roll out the
new feature to our end users. This allows us to verify the performance of the
new feature and that it actually solves the user problem it targets. In this
talk I will briefly introduce the feature toggle technique in general and how
this allows us to separate deploy and release of new features. I will also
introduce Unleash, an open source feature toggle system, we developed to solve
this issue._]

- In FINN -> treat master branch as highway to production.
- Everything we check in to master:
 - Will be built and integration test executed
 - Will be deployed to test-environments
 - Intgration tests will be executed
 - And new code will be ready to be deployed to production

(We have a custom built pipeline system to manage all this.)

# The master highway works well for <br /> small changes!

- bugfixes
- minor adjustments

---
# ...but not all changes are small
- **Some features requires more effort to be built**
 - days, weeks, months to be completed
 - multiple teams
 - multiple applications/services
- **Unfinished features should not be exposed to end users!**

# Feature branches
<img class="fullwitdh border" src="images/feature_branch_simple.jpg" />

???
- The traditional way to isolate new code
- A seperate branch for every new features
- New code will not hit production before you are ready.
- Delays the integration cost

# Concurrent branches

# Feature Branches - Summary

**Pros:**
- Safe to commit code in sperate branch
- No code will hit production before it is merged
- High degree of code isolation
- Code review via _pull-requests_

**Cons:**
- The *merge itself* can be very hard and costly!
- Difficult to share new code across banches
- Fear of refactoring shared code (frameworks / libs)
- How do we know that multiple features works well together?
- Continous integration, testing, demonstration difficult


???
Pros:
- Simple and safe
- No code hits production before you merge
- Easy to test new stuff without affecting others
- pull requests & code review

Cons:
- expensive to merge
- Difficult to share new code across banches
- Fear of refactoring
- Difficult to present your new features
- How do we know that multiple features works well together

# Feature Toggles

.img-src[https://www.flickr.com/photos/howzey/3805038515]

???
Feature Toggles is a simple technique
- allows us to work directly on master
- roll-out 'unfinished' code to production
- hides unfinished functionality from the user
- reducing risk associated with large change
- allows us to test new features in productin
- sperates deploy and release of new features
- Gives us controll:
 - when and how new featutes will be rolled out to our users.

# Feature toggles - summary

- Distinguish **release** and **deploy** of functionality
- We decide _who_ gets (and when) a new feature
- Test new features early in production
- Gradual roll-out of new features
- Lightning fast roll-back

# Decoupling <br /> .red[**deployment**] of code <br /> and <br /> .green[**release**] of new features


???
- deploy new code directly on master-branch
- helps to achieve the zero-downtime release.
- We can switch user from one version to the next
- enables developers to deploy new versions of application continuously
- completely independent of the decision as to which features are available
to which users.
- instantaneously rollback to previous release when required.


---
# Selective release

- Who should be exposed to a new feature?
- Test things on early users and react to their responses
- Detect problems before they get big


### ⇨ Gradual roll-out of features

Feature toggles combined with activation strategies
⇨ this is where the fun begins!
- Allows us to unleash our new features gradually

e.g.
- activate features only for specific users,
- active for specific client IPs
- active at a specified time.

# Activation strategies

Rules that decides when a _feature toggle_ is active
- basic on/off
- user
- role / permission
- date

Release toggles are supposed to make it easier and safer to push code out.
You can push code out only to a limited number of users to start, reducing
the impact of problems, or dark launch features incrementally, carefully
assessing added performance costs as you turn on some of the logic behind
the scenes, or run functions in parallel. And you can roll-back quickly by
turning off features or optional behaviour if something goes wrong or if
the system comes under too much load.

???
- A feature toggle is technical depth from the moment it is created
- Review flags often
- Delete feature toggles when you are finished with them
 - Very costly to maintain over team
 - Represent a different "path" in your application
- Avvoid permanent 'feature toggles' when possible

The plumbing and scaffolding logic to support branching in code becomes a nasty
form of technical debt, from the moment each feature switch is introduced.
Feature flags make the code more fragile and brittle, harder to test, harder to
understand and maintain, harder to support, and less secure.

Review flags often, make sure that you know which flags are on and which
are supposed to be on and when features are going to be removed

How to test?
- Each toggle represent a new path in your application
- General advice is to not test all possbible combination
- Test your code with the same toggle configuration you expect in production!

You might not see what your users see!
- Having a toggle turned on for yourself makes you somehting different than
your users!

# Avvoid feature toggles if you can!

.blockquote[Release toggles are a useful technique and lots of teams use them. However
they should be your last choice when you're dealing with putting features into
production.
<br />
<br />
Your first choice should be to break the feature down so you can safely
introduce parts of the feature into the product. The advantages of doing this
are the same ones as any strategy based on small, frequent releases. You reduce
the risk of things going wrong and you get valuable feedback on how users actually
use the feature that will improve the enhancements you make later.
]
.author[Martin Fowler]



???

- A toggle in itself is technical depth when it is created
- A new feature is a risk until it is in use by real users.
- Try to split up features first, only use feature toggles if necessary.

# Life cycle of a feature toggle

<img class="border" style="width: 60%;" src="images/feature_toggle_lifecycle.jpg" />

???

This lifecycle by just changing the activation strategy.


1. Start working on a new feature (disabled in production)
2. Enable the new feature for the team working on it
3. Enable the feature to a percentage of the users
4. Enable the feature for everyone
5. **Delete the feature toggle.**

# Unleash

.large[
- Feature toggles framework
 - Developed by FINN.no
 - All our _feature toggles_ in the same dashboard
 - A shared and robust client
 - KISS!
- Multiplatform
 - Implementations for Java and Node
- **It's open source!**
 - https://github.com/finn-no/unleash
]

???
- We started out with multiple simple toggle systems in FINN
- Configuration files, database-tables etc.
- Fairly general issue
- Wanted to have all toggles in one place for simplicity
- Make it dead simple for developers to take advantage of feature toggles.
- Right now we have XXX toggles in FINN.

Mere:
- Laget av ildsjeler i FINN fordi vi hadde lyst
- Enkelt å bruke toggles for alle
- Laget så liten og konsis som mulig
 - Grundig design upfront for å sikre konsistent API
- Open source
 - Koster selsvsagt litt ekstra
 - Gøy for oss som lager det
 - andre selskaper kan dra nytte av det vi gjør
 - andre selskaper kan bidra til en felles løsning
 - Schibsted Ready !!

## Feature toggles - summary

#### Pros
- No merge problems
- Allows us to deploy our code often
- Decoupling deployment and release
- Safer to refactor code on master branch
- Lightning fast rollback if problems are detected
- Selective release via activation strategies
- Iterate and improve new features

#### Cons
- Feature toggles are technical depth
- Accidential exposure of unfinished features
  - can be a security risk
- Testing becomes harder
- The code will be more fragile and harder to understand
- Long lived toggles are very costly!


???
- the main purpose of toggles is to perform release with minimum risk, once release is complete toggles need to be removed.
- Feature Flags need to be Short Lived
- eliminating the costs of maintaining and supporting long-lived branches.

---

# You should still use branches!

.large[
- But not for complete features!
- They should be short lived
- And you should use pull requests to get a good review process with your team
