# Unleash your features gradually

.small[
_At FINN.no we are 140 developers deploying code to production multiple times a
day. We have a few web applications and a few hundred running micro-services in
production and integrate code in production even before new features are ready
for the end user. And when the feature is complete we gradually roll out the
new feature to our end users. This allows us to verify the performance of the
new feature and that it actually solves the user problem it targets. In this
talk I will briefly introduce the feature toggle technique in general and how
this allows us to separate deploy and release of new features. I will also
introduce Unleash, an open source feature toggle system, we developed to solve
this issue._]

# master-branch == highway to production

- **~140 developers**
- **~385 deployable** projects
- **~650 artifacts** deployed weekly (prod)
]

???
- In FINN -> treat master branch as highway to production.
- Everything we check in to master:
 - Will be built and integration test executed
 - Will be deployed to test-environments
 - Intgration tests will be executed
 - And new code will be ready to be deployed to production

(We have a custom built pipeline system to manage all this.)

---
class: middle, center, inverse

# The master highway works well for small changes!

???
- bugfixes
- minor adjustments

---
# ...but not all changes are small
- **Some features requires more effort to be built**
 - days, weeks, months to be completed
 - multiple teams
 - multiple applications/services
- **Unfinished features should not be exposed to end users!**
---
# Feature branches
<img class="fullwitdh border" src="images/feature_branch_simple.jpg" />
- The traditional way to isolate new code
- Postpone integration

???
- a simple technique
- seperate branch for new features
- New code will not hit production before you are ready.

---
class: center, middle
<img  src="images/pull_request.png" style="width:50%;" />

???
- Pull Request => the best thing about branch and merge approach!
- Good support in many common tools:
 - GitHub
 - Stash
 - etc.

---
# Concurrent branches

<img class="fullwitdh border" src="images/feature_branch_double.jpg" />

???
 - Increased complexity with multiple branches
 - expensive to merge
 - We can reduse this by activley cost by syncing changes on master

---
class: background-img
<img  src="images/keep-refactoring-and-carry-on.png" />

???
Very hard to refactor the code when multiple concurrent branches exists
- framweworks and libraries
- "let refactor later!"

---
# Feature Branches - Summary

**Pros:**
- Safe to commit code in sperate branch
- No code will hit production before you are ready
- Easy to test new stuff without affecting others
- Code review via _pull-requests_

**Cons:**
- The merge itself can be very hard and costly
- Difficult to share new code across banches
- Fear of refactoring shared code (frameworks / libs)
- Difficult to present your new features
 - (Seperate test-envs per branch?)

???
Pros:
- Simple and safe
- No code hits production before you merge
- pull requests & code review

Cons:
- expensive to merge
- Difficult to share new code across banches
- Fear of refactoring
- Difficult to present your new features

# Feature Toggles
<img src="images/Merrydown_Cider Factory.jpg">

.img-src[https://www.flickr.com/photos/howzey/3805038515]

???
Feature Toggles is a simple technique
- allows us to work directly on master
- roll-out 'unfinished' code to production
- hides unfinished functionality from the user
- reducing risk associated with large change
- allows us to test new features in productin
- sperates deploy and release of new features
- Gives us controll:
 - when and how new featutes will be rolled out to our users.

-
---
# Feature toggles - summary
.large[
- Distinguish **release** and **deploy** of functionality
- We decide _who_ gets (and when) a new feature
- Test new features early in production
- Gradual roll-out of new features
- Lightning fast roll-back
]

##  Using flags and conditional statements to offer different experiences to different users or to turn on code

---
# Decoupling **deployment** of code and **release** of new features

Decoupling the deployment from the release helps to achieve the zero-downtime
release. With Zero-downtime release, switching user from one release
to another happens instantaneously

It also helps to instantaneously rollback to previous release when required.

This decoupling also enables dev and ops teams to deploy new versions of
application continuously, completely independent of the decision as to
which features are available to which users.

---
# selective release

- gradual roll-out
- detect problems before they get big
- test things on early users and react to responses.

---

if(unleash.isEnabled("AwesomeFeature")) {

A feature toggle is just a simple enkel if-test


---
# Minimal impact!

.large[
- Use as few **```if statements```** as possible
- Protect the **entry point** (the link) for new UI-components
- _New API's_ does not need protection
 - (exisiting clients does not know them anyway!)

# Clean up your mess!
<img src="images/pollution.jpg">

.img-src[https://www.flickr.com/photos/epsos/5444678656/]

???
The plumbing and scaffolding logic to support branching in code becomes a nasty
form of technical debt, from the moment each feature switch is introduced.
Feature flags make the code more fragile and brittle, harder to test, harder to
understand and maintain, harder to support, and less secure.


---
# Clean up your mess!
- A feature toggle is technical depth from the moment it is created
- Review flags often
- Delete feature toggles when you are finished with them
 - Very costly to maintain over team
 - Represent a different "path" in your application
- Avvoid permanent 'feature toggles' when possible

---
# Avvoid feature toggles if you can!

- A toggle in itself is technical depth when it is created
- A new feature is a risk until it is in use by real users.
- Try to split up features first, only use feature toggles if necessary.

"Release toggles are supposed to make it easier and safer to push code out.
You can push code out only to a limited number of users to start, reducing
the impact of problems, or dark launch features incrementally, carefully
assessing added performance costs as you turn on some of the logic behind
the scenes, or run functions in parallel. And you can roll-back quickly by
turning off features or optional behaviour if something goes wrong or if
the system comes under too much load.

# Activation strategies


### Responsible to decide whether a feature is active or not.
### Allows us to decide for _who_ and _when_ a new feature should be active.

???
e.g.
- activate features only for specific users,
- active for specific client IPs
- active at a specified time.

---
# Activation strategies: examples

- Active for everyone
- Active for specific users
- Actove for specific client IPs
- Active on specific server nodes
- Active after a specific date
- Gradual Rollout to a percentage of our users

(
- basic on/off
- user
- role / permission
- date
- servernode
)

Rules that decides when a _feature toggle_ is active

- user
- role / permission

Release toggles are supposed to make it easier and safer to push code out.
You can push code out only to a limited number of users to start, reducing
the impact of problems, or dark launch features incrementally, carefully
assessing added performance costs as you turn on some of the logic behind
the scenes, or run functions in parallel. And you can roll-back quickly by
turning off features or optional behaviour if something goes wrong or if
the system comes under too much load.


???
- feature toggles => increased controll of access to new feature
- can gradually roll out our new features
- very simple to roll back features
 - if we discover errors
 - if the new feature is not perfomring

---
- Summary of toggles
- Pros and Cons toggles
- avvoid them if you can!


### Pros
- making merge problems go away
- eliminating the costs of maintaining and supporting long-lived branches.
- reduce deployment risk
- easy and fast rollback of features if problems are detected
-

### Cons
- feature toggles are technical depth
- makes the code more fragile
- harder to test
- harder to understand and maintain, harder to support


thus:
Feature Flags need to be Short Lived
- the main purpose of toggles is to perform release with minimum risk, once release is complete toggles need to be removed.

# Unleash
.large[
- Feature toggles framework, developed by FINN.no
 - All our _feature toggles_ in the same tool
 - A shared and robust client
- A cross team effort in FINN
- It's open source
]

#### GitHub: https://github.com/finn-no/unleash

???
- We started out with multiple simple toggle systems in FINN
- Configuration files, database-tables etc.
- Fairly general issue
- Wanted to have all toggles in one place for simplicity
- Make it dead simple for developers to take advantage of feature toggles.
- Right now we have XXX toggles in FINN.

Mere:
- Laget av ildsjeler i FINN fordi vi hadde lyst
- Enkelt å bruke toggles for alle
- Laget så liten og konsis som mulig
 - Grundig design upfront for å sikre konsistent API
- Open source
 - Koster selsvsagt litt ekstra
 - Gøy for oss som lager det
 - andre selskaper kan dra nytte av det vi gjør
 - andre selskaper kan bidra til en felles løsning
 - Schibsted Ready !!

- The robust client
- Local in-memory representation
- Local persisted last-known representation
- Poll-based updates via REST (15s default)
- Multiple implementations:
 - Java Client - https://github.com/finn-no/unleash-client-java
 - Node Client - https://github.com/finn-no/unleash-client-node

???
- The robust, and kind of **fat**, client

# Life cycle of a feature toggle

<img class="border" style="width: 60%;" src="images/feature_toggle_lifecycle.jpg" />

???

This lifecycle by just changing the activation strategy.


1. Start working on a new feature (disabled in production)
2. Enable the new feature for the team working on it
3. Enable the feature to a percentage of the users
4. Enable the feature for everyone
5. **Delete the feature toggle.**
