At FINN.no we are 140 developers deploying code to production multiple times a
day. We have a few web applications and a few hundred running micro-services in
production and integrate code in production even before new features are ready
for the end user. And when the feature is complete we gradually roll out the
new feature to our end users. This allows us to verify the performance of the
new feature and that it actually solves the user problem it targets. In this
talk I will briefly introduce the feature toggle technique in general and how
this allows us to separate deploy and release of new features. I will also
introduce Unleash, an open source feature toggle system, we developed to solve
this issue.
